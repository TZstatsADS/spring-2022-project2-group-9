**Project Summary:** 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a drastic impact on all of us whether it’s losing a job, getting behind on rent or mortgage payments, or struggling to bring food to the table. It has been even harder for low income families to have access to the resources they need to stay safe and healthy. In an effort to help low income families, specifically the youth, as they might find it challenging to navigate these unprecedented times, we created this app. We’re hopeful that our aggregated resources to covid and flu vaccination sites, food, shelter, after school centers, job/internship opportunities, and crime rates will play a small but crucial role in supporting the youth of New York City.

In this app, We mainly developed 3 functions, the interactive map, statistical analysis and about.

+ Interactive Map:
  + Locations for Covid vaccination, flu shots, wifi, food centers, drop in centers, youth shelters, job/internship centers
  + Heatmap distribution of covid cases and crime 

+ Statistical Analysis:
  + Graphs of crime status during covid pandemic, explanation for some phenomena and conclusion 
  + Graphs of housing status during covid pandemic, explanation for some phenomena and conclusion 

+ About:
  + Links to data sources, data disclaimer, app contributors

- **Sharon Meng**: Recorded the process of the whole project regularly on a team google doc and hosted zoom meetings for remote communication. Designed the template for the Shiny App page including `Home` and `Statistical Analysis` page. Cleaned and visualized all related data about crime, housing and COVID status in NYC to create plots in the `Statistical Analysis` page, explained the graphs and came out with some conclusions. Organized all files used in this app and wrote all `xxx.md` files in Github.
